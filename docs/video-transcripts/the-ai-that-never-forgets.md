### [00:00] - Introduction: The Ephemeral AI Problem

**[Visual: Black screen fades to scattered, disconnected circles representing isolated AI sessions]**

Every time you start a new session with Claude, ChatGPT, or any AI assistant, you're beginning from zero.

**[00:10]** The AI doesn't remember your debugging session from yesterday. It doesn't recall the Docker configuration that finally worked last week. It has no memory of the solution you discovered three weeks ago.

**[00:20]** **[Visual: Circles fade and disappear, symbolizing lost knowledge]**

This is the fundamental problem of ephemeral AI - every conversation exists in isolation, like islands of knowledge that never connect.

### [00:45] - Current Limitations

**[Visual: Split screen showing a developer repeatedly explaining the same context to an AI]**

Consider Sarah, a developer working on a complex microservices architecture.

**[00:55]** Monday: She spends 30 minutes explaining her project structure to Claude.
**[01:05]** Tuesday: She explains it again to help debug a Docker issue.
**[01:15]** Friday: She's explaining the same context for the third time this week.

**[Visual: Clock spinning, showing wasted time accumulating]**

### [01:30] - The Vision

**[Visual: Smooth transition to connected nodes beginning to form]**

But what if your AI assistant could remember?

**[01:40]** What if every solution, every debugging session, every piece of context became part of a permanent, evolving knowledge base?

**[01:50]** **[Visual: Nodes connecting with glowing lines, forming a constellation]**

What if your AI had... one mind?

### [02:15] - Graphiti Solution

**[Visual: Animation of a temporal knowledge graph growing over time]**

Enter Graphiti - a temporal knowledge graph that never forgets.

**[02:25]** Unlike traditional RAG systems that simply store and retrieve documents, Graphiti builds relationships. It understands that your Docker fix is related to your deployment pipeline, which connects to your GTD task for "improve CI/CD."

**[02:40]** **[Visual: Graph nodes labeled with actual examples: "Docker SSL Fix", "OrbStack Config", "Deployment Task"]**

**[02:50]** Every interaction strengthens the graph. Every solution becomes permanent knowledge. Every context builds upon the last.

### [03:00] - Architecture

**[Visual: Architectural diagram showing Claude Code, Graphiti MCP, Neo4j, and GTD Coach]**

The architecture is elegantly simple:

**[03:10]** Your Claude Code sessions write to a shared Neo4j knowledge graph through the Graphiti MCP server.

**[03:20]** **[Visual: Data flowing from Claude Code through Graphiti into Neo4j]**

**[03:25]** The same graph is accessed by your GTD Coach, creating cross-domain insights.

**[03:35]** Temporal decay ensures recent memories are weighted higher, just like human memory.

### [03:45] - Real Example

**[Visual: Calendar showing weeks passing, with a specific problem highlighted]**

Let me show you a real example.

**[03:50]** Three weeks ago, you solved a complex SSL certificate issue with OrbStack and Docker.

**[03:58]** **[Visual: Fast-forward animation to "Today"]**

Today, you encounter a similar issue.

### [04:03] - One Mind Concept

**[Visual: All separate elements converge into a single, unified circle labeled "ONE MIND"]**

This is the moment everything changes.

**[04:08]** Instead of starting over, Claude instantly recalls: "I remember this pattern. Three weeks ago, we solved this by updating the OrbStack SSL certificates in /Users/.orbstack/certs."

**[04:20]** **[Visual: The One Mind circle pulses with recognition]**

One mind. Continuous memory. Perpetual learning.

### [04:30] - Benefits

**[Visual: Split view showing parallel benefits]**

The benefits cascade:

**[04:35]** **Development**: No more re-explaining context
**[04:40]** **Debugging**: Solutions from weeks ago instantly available
**[04:45]** **Learning**: Patterns emerge from accumulated experience
**[04:50]** **Productivity**: GTD tasks informed by coding insights

**[04:55]** **[Visual: Benefits connecting back to the One Mind circle]**

### [05:00] - Call to Action

**[Visual: GitHub repository page with star count increasing]**

This isn't science fiction. It's running in production today.

**[05:10]** Graphiti Claude Code MCP is open source. The revolution in persistent AI memory starts with developers like you.

**[05:20]** **[Visual: Installation command appears]**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/devops-adeel/graphiti-claude-code-mcp
make setup
```

**[05:28]** Join us in building AI that truly remembers.

**[05:33]** **[Visual: Fade to project logo]**

**[05:35]** The AI that never forgets.

**[05:38]** **[End]**
